Once you have completed your implementation, review and respond to the questions below. Each of your responses should be at least four sentences.

----- Question 1 -----

What kinds of faults can your peer-to-peer chat implementation tolerate? Faults may include problems with machines or the network, as well as program crashes. Be specific about what failure situations you could tolerate, and explain how the system can continue to work in the face of these failures.

---- Response ----



---- Question 2 ----

What faults will cause your peer-to-peer chat to fail, or to operate in some diminished capacity? Again, be specific about the situations that will result in failure.

---- Response ----



---- Question 3 ----

One mechanism for tolerating failure is replication. If each client connected to two existing peers instead of just one, would that help you tolerate any additional faults? What problems could this change create for your implementation?

---- Response ----



---- Question 4 ----

Describe one additional change you could make to the peer-to-peer chat system that would allow it to tolerate faults. Describe how you would implement this change, and at least one example of how it would allow you to tolerate a fault.

---- Response ----
